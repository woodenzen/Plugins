# New Note with Timestamp
_A plugin for "The Archive" application_

Creates a new note with timestamp and title
  - The user is prompted for a title
  - The filename is made from the current timestamp and the sanitized title
  - A front matter is inserted at the top of the created note

NB:
  - The timestamp is precise to the minute
  - the front matter structure is hardcoded
